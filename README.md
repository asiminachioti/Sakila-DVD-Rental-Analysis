# Sakila-DVD-Rental-Analysis ðŸŽ¬

This repository provides a set of **22 SQL queries** for analyzing and exploring the Sakila sample database, a MySQL-developed database that simulates a fictional DVD rental store.

Each question is designed to extract meaningful insights - from sales performance and customer behavior to inventory management â€” while demonstrating practical SQL techniques.
There is also a sample output provided under each query for verification!

Happy querying! ðŸŽ¥ðŸ’¿
